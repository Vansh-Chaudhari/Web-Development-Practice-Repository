        Combining 135+ years of trust of Dabur with the purity and nourishment of finest hand-picked and sun-dried
        coconuts available in India, we created Anmol Coconut Oil. Dabur Anmol Coconut Oil undergoes 34 quality tests.
        It has a long-lasting shelf life of 18 months. The fresh coconut fragrance is kept intact using tamper proof
        seal and multi-stage filtration process. The regular use of edible Coconut Oil helps provide the required
        antioxidants and boosts immunity. Coconut Oil has traditionally been used as massage oil and helps improve skin
        metabolism. It can be used as a cooking oil providing nourishment and nutrition to the body, can be used with
        moisturizers to protect the skin from everyday damage and can also be used as a makeup remover. Regular usage of
        coconut oil for haircare provides abundant nourishment. <br><br>
