üìÅ Web Development Practice Repository
This repository contains all the web development code I've written during my learning and practice sessions. It includes hands-on work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related technologies. I'm using this space to document my progress, explore new concepts, and build a strong foundation in front-end and full-stack development.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my journey!
